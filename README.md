Pez is a teeny tiny platform layer for building simple OpenGL demos.  It's composed of a single header file and single C99 source file.

Pez lets you create a simple, fixed-size window and render to it with OpenGL.  That's all.  It's just for creating small demos and tests; if you're building a real application, you should probably use a real library like SDL or GLFW.

Your OpenGL demo needs to implement a few functions:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
